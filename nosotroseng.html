                        <div class="ex1">Everything has a reason for being, sometimes life joins paths in an inexplicable way, that maybe they were not destined to meet, but the desire to build a better future was the light that guided them to be what they are now. Thus began a new day, a new dawn, a new opportunity.<br/>
                            It was the year 2028, society craved a new tomorrow, such was the case of a young civil engineer, whose expectation of working for a major construction company was collapsed when she learned that the construction company ALTAS triumphed at the expense of the destruction of natural habitats and deaths of millions of animals, silencing the media with bundles of bills and threatening without compassion anyone who dared to challenge him. Edith Castañeda upon learning of this decides to move away from this toxic environment by giving up the company immediately; after being unemployed for 4 months, she finds the right person to rebuild her future, Sofía Torres, a young lawyer with a degree in business administration, ready to fight for justice and defend who deserves to be defended, that's how it all began.<br/>
                            After talking about what has already happened, Sofía proposes a difficult offer to ignore, where she would have the opportunity to develop and, most importantly, to make a change protecting the place where we live. Edith takes time to think about the offer and study the advantages it would have. Meanwhile, Sofia closes another deal behind bars; Alejandro Cárdenas, a boy whose fate left him long ago, wrongly accused of business fraud in the company DANTHOP receives the same offer from Sofia, if he will accept, she in return would do everything legally possible to prove his innocence.<br/>
                            And so it was, 7 months later Alejandro's best friend, Carlos Seda, who gets enough evidence to clarify everything. Upon leaving, he decides to join the project with the illusion of working for a company with values, not only moral, but also intellectual and social. Carlos Seda and Alejandro Cárdenas, engineers in computer technologies, were now part of what in the future would be the best construction nationwide.
                            Once with Alejandro free and Carlos on her side, Sofia decides to contact Edith one more time, she had not spoken to her since their last meeting, when she proposed her offer, pleasant surprise was when she decided to agree to join the project. Weeks later they agreed to meet the 4 in a cafeteria in front of an abandoned building, although they thought they were complete, they felt that something was missing. They began to discuss the future of the project, meeting each time in the same cafe, at the same table, everything was planned, they knew that soon they would start with their company, they still did not find a suitable place since they required a wide space in which to be it was nice, with good natural light and full view of people, that was what they were thinking when one of them looked up and saw it, that old and abandoned building that was across the street suddenly looked beautiful, with its large windows and old design, looked stunning before the eyes of anyone; the hunch came like a torrent, he had visualized it and he imagined that monument was already his because he knew with a few renovations and a little maintenance would be perfect carrying the initials of his next company on high; He quickly commented with the others his idea, who immediately shared his opinion.<br/>
                            A month later it was almost all ready, they had talked to the owner of the building who kindly agreed to sign a contract, but Carlos had discovered that it was what was bothering him, a week ago he had contacted an old friend, a university friend, both of whom used to take very well but he decided to take another path, Alejandro Lopez was now in Asia, on a secret mission against the Russian government, an excellent CIA agent who gave his all in each mission, the time Carlos spoke with him was desperate, he had lost an eye in his last battle and when he received the offer from his friend he did not hesitate a second to accept it.<br/>
                            Although Carlos had not told his co-workers and now friends about the arrival of Alejandro Lopez, deep down he knew that they would not have any problem, Lopez was something his team needed, even if they did not know it yet; just as he predicted, they welcomed the second Alejandro and now a new partner. Once the entire team started to raise the company, and this was how the 5 promising young people, founded one of the leading construction companies in Mexico, improving the country's economy and giving stability and security to customers.</div>
